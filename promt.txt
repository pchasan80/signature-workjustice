Let's develop an HTML email signature specifically optimized for Gmail for The Work Justice Firm.

Their website: https://www.workjustice.com/

Project Concept:

We will create a web-based HTML signature generator. Users will fill out a form with their personal details — including name, job title, contact information, and a professional photo. After submitting the form, the system will generate a fully formatted HTML email signature. Users will then be able to copy the generated HTML and paste it directly into their Gmail signature settings.

Signature Layout & Design Requirements:

The email signature should use a two-column layout.

Signature width will be total 600px. The left column will be 200px and right column will be 400px.

Left Column:

A tall professional headshot of the user (portrait orientation for a clean, premium look).

Right Column:

User’s full name

Job title

A neatly organized list of contact details with icons (email, phone, address, website, fax)
